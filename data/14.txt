GARDENING BASICS FOR BEGINNERS

STARTING SEEDS INDOORS

1. Timing matters. Start seeds 6-8 weeks before last frost date in your area.

2. Use sterile seed starting mix. Garden soil can harbor diseases that kill seedlings.

3. Containers need drainage holes. Egg cartons work well for small seeds.

4. Keep soil moist but not waterlogged. Too much water causes rot.

5. Light is crucial. South-facing windows are best. Grow lights help.

CHOOSING PLANTS

EASY VEGETABLES:
- Lettuce grows fast in cool weather
- Radishes mature in 30 days
- Bush beans produce continuously
- Zucchini gives huge harvests from few plants

EASY FLOWERS:
- Marigolds deter pests
- Sunflowers are dramatic and simple
- Zinnias bloom all summer
- Cosmos reseed themselves

SOIL PREPARATION

Test pH first. Most vegetables prefer 6.0-7.0.

Add compost yearly. Improves structure and nutrients.

Avoid walking on garden beds. Compaction hurts roots.

Mulch around plants. Reduces weeds, retains moisture.

WATERING GUIDE

Morning watering is best. Leaves dry before evening.

Deep watering once weekly is better than frequent shallow watering.

Check soil 2 inches deep. If dry, time to water.

Drip irrigation saves water and reduces disease problems.

COMPANION PLANTING

GOOD COMBINATIONS:
- Tomatoes with basil
- Carrots with onions
- Beans with corn
- Roses with garlic

AVOID THESE PAIRS:
- Tomatoes with potatoes
- Beans with onions
- Cabbage with strawberries
- Cucumbers with sage

PEST CONTROL NATURAL

Handpick large insects like hornworms.

Spray aphids with soapy water solution.

Plant marigolds and nasturtiums as trap crops.

Encourage beneficial insects with diverse plantings.

Use row covers to protect vulnerable crops.

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. Planting too early. Check frost dates religiously.

2. Overcrowding. Read seed spacing instructions carefully.

3. Watering leaves. Water soil directly to prevent fungal diseases.

4. Ignoring weeds. They compete for nutrients and water.

5. Forgetting to label. You'll forget what you planted where.

HARVESTING TIPS

Pick vegetables when young and tender for best flavor.

Cut herbs in morning after dew dries but before heat of day.

Use clean scissors to prevent disease spread.

Harvest frequently. Plants produce more when picked regularly.

SEASON EXTENSION

Cold frames protect fall crops through light frosts.

Row covers add 2-4 degrees of protection.

Mulch heavily before winter to protect perennial roots.

Consider small greenhouse for year-round growing.

SUCCESS TIPS

Start small. Three or four types of plants first year.

Keep a garden journal. Note what works and what doesn't.

Visit local nurseries. Staff know regional growing conditions.

Join community garden. Learn from experienced gardeners.

Be patient. Every season brings new learning opportunities.

Remember: gardening is both science and art. Some years everything thrives, other years challenges arise. The joy is in the process and the satisfaction of growing your own food.
