Evaluating Search Result Quality

Measuring how well a retrieval system performs requires carefully designed evaluation frameworks with appropriate metrics and test collections.

Relevance judgments form evaluation foundations. Human assessors review query-document pairs, assigning relevance grades. Binary (relevant/not relevant) judgments simplify but lose nuance; graded scales (highly relevant/somewhat relevant/not relevant) capture varying degrees of usefulness.

Standard metrics for ranked results include:

Precision@k: Among top k results, what fraction is relevant?
- Useful when users examine only top results
- Doesn't consider position within top k

Recall@k: Of all relevant documents, what fraction appears in top k?
- Important when finding all relevant content matters
- Requires knowledge of complete relevant set

Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): Average of 1/position for first relevant result
- Rewards systems that rank relevant results highly
- Only considers single relevant document

Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG): 
- Handles graded relevance
- Applies logarithmic discount to lower positions
- Normalizes against ideal ranking
- Standard metric for many retrieval benchmarks

Mean Average Precision (MAP): Average precision at each relevant document
- Rewards both precision and recall
- Considers entire ranking, not just top k

Creating test collections requires:
- Representative query sets spanning user needs
- Sufficient relevant documents per query
- Consistent judgment guidelines
- Multiple assessors for reliability

Benchmark datasets enable method comparison:
- MS MARCO: Large-scale passage retrieval
- TREC collections: Various domains and tasks
- BEIR: Diverse evaluation across domains
- Natural Questions: Question answering retrieval

Online evaluation through A/B testing captures real user behavior:
- Click-through rates
- Time to first click
- Query reformulation rates
- Task completion rates

Offline and online metrics may diverge—improvements in one don't guarantee improvement in the other. Comprehensive evaluation combines both approaches.
