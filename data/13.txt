Medical Case Study: Rare Autoimmune Disorder Presenting with Neurological Symptoms

Patient Profile:
Age: 34
Gender: Female
Occupation: Software engineer
Medical History: Hypothyroidism, seasonal allergies

PRESENTATION

The patient presented to the neurology clinic with a three-month history of progressive neurological symptoms including intermittent facial numbness, bilateral hand tremors, and episodic dysphagia. Initial symptoms began with occasional tingling in the left facial region, which progressed over weeks to include persistent numbness affecting the trigeminal nerve distribution.

Associated symptoms included:
- Unintentional weight loss of 7kg over 2 months
- Persistent fatigue affecting daily activities
- Episodes of blurred vision lasting 2-3 hours
- Mild cognitive difficulties described as "brain fog"
- Occasional urinary urgency

INITIAL WORKUP

Laboratory findings:
- CBC: WNL
- ESR: 28 mm/hr (elevated)
- CRP: 12 mg/L (elevated)
- Thyroid panel: TSH 8.4 mIU/L (elevated), free T4 normal
- Vitamin B12: 152 pg/mL (low)
- Vitamin D: 18 ng/mL (deficient)

Imaging studies:
- MRI brain: Multiple hyperintense lesions in periventricular white matter
- Cervical spine MRI: No significant abnormalities
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: No acute findings

DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES

Lumbar puncture revealed:
- Opening pressure: 18 cm H2O
- WBC: 45 cells/μL (lymphocytic predominance)
- Protein: 85 mg/dL (elevated)
- Glucose: 65 mg/dL (normal)
- Oligoclonal bands: Present

Autoimmune panel showed:
- ANA: Positive (1:640, speckled pattern)
- Anti-Ro/SSA: Positive
- Anti-La/SSB: Positive
- Anti-dsDNA: Negative
- Anti-Sm: Negative

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Considered diagnoses included:
1. Multiple sclerosis (MS)
2. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD)
3. Sjögren's syndrome with neurological involvement
4. Sarcoidosis
5. Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome

Additional testing:
- Aquaporin-4 antibodies: Negative
- MOG antibodies: Negative
- ACE level: Normal
- Cancer screening: Negative

FINAL DIAGNOSIS

Primary Sjögren's syndrome with central nervous system involvement (neuro-Sjögren's), secondary to autoimmune-mediated demyelination.

TREATMENT PLAN

Phase 1: Acute management
- High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1g daily for 5 days
- Plasmapheresis (5 exchanges over 10 days)
- IVIG 2g/kg divided over 5 days

Phase 2: Maintenance therapy
- Mycophenolate mofetil 1g twice daily
- Low-dose prednisone taper
- Hydroxychloroquine 400mg daily
- Pilocarpine for xerostomia

Phase 3: Supportive care
- Physical therapy for gait and balance
- Occupational therapy for fine motor skills
- Speech therapy for dysphagia management
- Cognitive rehabilitation exercises

CLINICAL COURSE

Week 1-2: Initial improvement in facial numbness and energy levels
Month 1: Significant reduction in tremor frequency and severity
Month 3: MRI shows decreased lesion enhancement and size
Month 6: Near-complete resolution of sensory symptoms, mild residual cognitive fog persists

PROGNOSIS AND FOLLOW-UP

The patient's prognosis is guarded but favorable with aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. Key factors include:
- Early diagnosis and treatment initiation
- Younger age at presentation
- Limited disability at presentation
- Good response to initial therapy

Potential complications to monitor:
- Disease relapse during steroid taper
- Medication side effects (mycophenolate toxicity, steroid effects)
- Development of lymphoma (increased risk in Sjögren's)
- Progressive neurological disability

Follow-up schedule:
- Neurology: Every 3 months initially, then every 6 months
- Rheumatology: Every 4 months
- Ophthalmology: Every 6 months (monitor for dry eye complications)
- Primary care: Every 3 months for medication monitoring

DISCUSSION

This case highlights several important aspects of neuro-Sjögren's syndrome:

1. Atypical Presentation: While Sjögren's syndrome typically presents with sicca symptoms (dry eyes, dry mouth), neurological manifestations can precede these classic features by months or years.

2. Diagnostic Challenges: The overlap with multiple sclerosis in clinical presentation and MRI findings creates diagnostic uncertainty. Positive autoantibodies (anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB) and evidence of systemic autoimmunity help distinguish the conditions.

3. Treatment Considerations: While MS therapies focus on disease-modifying treatments, neuro-Sjögren's typically requires broader immunosuppression. Plasmapheresis and IVIG can be beneficial in acute presentations.

4. Multidisciplinary Approach: Optimal care requires coordination between neurology, rheumatology, ophthalmology, and rehabilitation services.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

- Consider autoimmune causes in patients with atypical demyelinating presentations
- Comprehensive autoantibody testing should be included in demyelinating disease workup
- Early rheumatology consultation is crucial when systemic autoimmune features are present
- Monitor closely for both neurological and systemic complications
- Patient education about disease variability and treatment side effects is essential

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Emerging therapies for neuro-Sjögren's include:
- B-cell depletion therapies (rituximab)
- Targeted cytokine inhibitors
- Novel agents targeting specific autoantibody production
- Personalized medicine approaches based on genetic and immunological profiling

Research continues into better biomarkers for disease activity and treatment response, as well as improved understanding of the pathophysiology of autoimmune-mediated central nervous system damage.
