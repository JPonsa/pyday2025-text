Grandma's Traditional Apple Pie Recipe

This family heirloom recipe has been passed down through five generations and makes the most delicious homemade apple pie you'll ever taste. Perfect for holidays, family gatherings, or just a cozy evening at home.

Ingredients:
For the crust:
- 2½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 cup cold butter, cut into small cubes
- 6-8 tablespoons ice water

For the filling:
- 6-8 medium apples (Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or Braeburn work best)
- ¾ cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions:
1. Start by preparing the crust. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar. Add the cold butter cubes and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces remaining.

2. Gradually add the ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing gently with a fork until the dough just comes together. Don't overmix. Divide the dough in half, shape each half into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

3. While the crust chills, prepare the filling. Peel, core, and slice the apples about ¼-inch thick. In a large bowl, combine the apple slices with sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Toss gently to coat evenly.

4. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disk of dough to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Carefully transfer the crust to the pie dish and trim the edges.

5. Pour the apple filling into the prepared crust, mounding it slightly in the center. Dot the top with small pieces of butter and sprinkle with vanilla extract.

6. Roll out the second disk of dough for the top crust. You can either place it whole and cut steam vents, or cut it into strips for a lattice top. If using a whole top crust, cut several slits to allow steam to escape.

7. Trim the top crust, leaving about ½-inch overhang. Fold the edge of the top crust under the edge of the bottom crust and press together to seal. Crimp the edges decoratively.

8. Brush the top crust with a little milk or cream and sprinkle with sugar for a golden, sparkling finish.

9. Bake at 425°F for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 375°F (190°C) and continue baking for another 35-45 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.

10. Let the pie cool for at least 2 hours before slicing. This allows the filling to set properly.

Pro tips for perfect apple pie:
