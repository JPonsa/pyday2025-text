Mexican Street Tacos: Authentic Recipes and Techniques

Authentic Mexican street tacos differ significantly from American versions. Small, double-corn tortillas topped simply with meat, onion, cilantro, and lime create the perfect bite.

Essential Equipment:
- Comal (flat griddle) or cast iron skillet
- Tortilla press (or heavy-bottomed pan)
- Small bowls for toppings
- Tongs for handling hot tortillas

Corn Tortillas from Scratch:
- 2 cups masa harina
- 1.5 cups warm water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Mix masa with water until smooth dough forms. Let rest 30 minutes. Divide into 16 balls, press between plastic-lined tortilla press. Cook 30 seconds per side on hot comal.

Classic Fillings:

Carnitas (Slow-Cooked Pork)
- 2kg pork shoulder, cut into chunks
- 1 orange, halved

Simmer 3 hours until tender, then fry in own fat until crispy edges.

Al Pastor (Marinated Pork)
- 1kg pork leg, thinly sliced
- 1 cup pineapple juice
- 3 dried guajillo chiles

Marinate 4 hours minimum. Grill with pineapple chunks for authentic flavor.

Carne Asada (Grilled Beef)
- 1kg skirt steak
- Juice of 4 limes

Assembly:
