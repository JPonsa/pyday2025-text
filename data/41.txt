Treating Persistent Headaches: A Medical Guide

Chronic head pain affects millions worldwide, significantly impacting quality of life. Understanding different types helps determine appropriate treatment approaches.

Tension-type headaches present as band-like pressure around the head. Often triggered by stress, poor posture, or eye strain, they typically respond to over-the-counter analgesics and lifestyle modifications. Regular breaks from screen work and stress management techniques provide preventive benefits.

Migraines involve intense, often unilateral throbbing accompanied by nausea and light sensitivity. These neurological events may include aura (visual disturbances) and can last hours to days. Triptans provide acute relief while preventive medications reduce frequency for chronic sufferers.

Cluster headaches cause severe pain around one eye, occurring in cyclical patterns. Oxygen therapy and sumatriptan injections offer acute treatment, while verapamil may prevent cluster periods.

Secondary headaches indicate underlying conditions requiring investigation. Warning signs include sudden severe onset ("thunderclap"), fever, neurological symptoms, or onset after head injury. Imaging and specialist evaluation become essential.

Prevention strategies applicable across types:
- Maintaining regular sleep schedules
- Staying hydrated
- Managing stress through exercise or meditation
- Identifying and avoiding personal triggers
- Limiting caffeine and alcohol consumption

When to seek immediate medical attention:
- Worst headache of your life
- Headache with fever and stiff neck
- Confusion or personality changes
- Weakness or numbness accompanying pain
- Visual disturbances without prior migraine history

Treatment effectiveness varies individually. Keeping a headache diary tracking frequency, intensity, triggers, and medications helps healthcare providers optimize treatment plans.
