Feline Companions: Understanding Cat Behavior

Domestic cats exhibit complex behavioral patterns rooted in their evolutionary history as solitary hunters. Understanding these behaviors enhances the human-feline bond.

Communication signals include:
- Slow blinks: Trust and affection
- Tail position: Upright indicates confidence, tucked shows fear
- Ear orientation: Forward means attentive, flattened signals aggression
- Vocalizations: Meows primarily evolved for human communication

Hunting instincts remain strong despite domestication. Indoor cats benefit from:
- Interactive play mimicking prey movement
- Puzzle feeders engaging hunting skills
- Window perches for environmental enrichment
- Rotating toy selection preventing boredom

Territorial marking behaviors:
- Scratching deposits visual and scent marks
- Facial rubbing transfers pheromones to objects
- Urine marking (typically unneutered males)
- Bunting (head butting) claims ownership

Sleep patterns differ from humans. Cats are crepuscular, most active at dawn and dusk. They sleep 12-16 hours daily in multiple short periods, always remaining alert enough to respond to stimuli.

Social structure varies individually. Some cats thrive with feline companions while others prefer solitary environments. Proper introductions and adequate resources (litter boxes, feeding stations, resting spots) reduce conflict in multi-cat households.

Stress indicators include:
- Excessive grooming or neglected grooming
- Changes in appetite or elimination
- Hiding or reduced activity
- Aggression toward humans or other pets

Veterinary visits cause significant stress. Carrier conditioning, familiar scents, and pheromone sprays reduce anxiety. Many cats benefit from cats-only veterinary practices.
