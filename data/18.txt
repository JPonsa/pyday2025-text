Reinforcement Learning: From Q-Learning to Deep RL

Reinforcement learning tackles sequential decision-making problems where agents learn optimal policies through interaction with environments. The field has evolved from simple tabular methods to sophisticated deep learning approaches capable of superhuman performance.

Q-learning introduced the concept of value functions, estimating the expected future reward for taking actions in states. However, Q-learning struggles with high-dimensional state spaces, limiting its applicability to simple problems.

Deep Q-Networks (DQN) combined convolutional neural networks with Q-learning, enabling direct learning from raw pixels. Key innovations including experience replay, target networks, and reward clipping stabilized training for complex environments like Atari games.

Policy gradient methods directly optimize policies using gradient ascent on expected rewards. REINFORCE algorithm provides simple but high-variance gradient estimates, while Actor-Critic methods combine value function learning with policy optimization for better sample efficiency.

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) address policy stability through constrained optimization. These algorithms achieve reliable performance across continuous and discrete action spaces.

Modern advances include off-policy algorithms like SAC (Soft Actor-Critic), model-based RL with learned dynamics models, and meta-learning approaches that enable rapid adaptation to new tasks. Applications span robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.
