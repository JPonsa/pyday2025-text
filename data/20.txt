Generative AI: Diffusion Models and Beyond

Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art approaches for generative modeling across images, audio, and video. These models work by gradually adding noise to data during training and then learning to reverse this process to generate new samples.

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) establish the theoretical foundation for diffusion-based generation. The forward process systematically corrupts data with Gaussian noise over multiple timesteps, while the reverse process learns to denoise step by step. This gradual approach enables stable training and high-quality sample generation.

Latent Diffusion Models like Stable Diffusion significantly reduce computational requirements by operating in compressed latent spaces rather than pixel space. This efficiency enables generation of high-resolution images with modest GPU resources while maintaining quality.

Conditional diffusion models accept additional inputs like text descriptions or class labels for controlled generation. CLIP-guided diffusion allows text-to-image synthesis by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models for guidance during generation.

Applications include image editing, super-resolution, style transfer, and inpainting. Diffusion models also excel at audio generation, speech synthesis, and molecular structure generation in drug discovery.

Recent advances include consistency models that enable single-step generation, stochastic differential equation interpretations, and applications to 3D content generation. The field continues to evolve rapidly, with new architectures improving sample quality and generation speed.
