This document contains repetitive keyword stuffing to demonstrate why raw term frequency alone provides poor relevance signals.

Notice how this document would score extremely high on raw term frequency for "machine learning" queries despite providing zero actual information about the topic.

Search engines evolved beyond simple term counting specifically because of manipulation attempts like this. TF-IDF's inverse document frequency component helps by recognizing these terms appear broadly across documents.

BM25's saturation function further addresses this by applying diminishing returns to repeated terms. After several occurrences, additional repetitions contribute minimally to relevance scores.

Modern algorithms additionally detect:
- Unnaturally high keyword density
- Lack of semantic coherence
- Missing related terms that should co-occur
- Statistical anomalies in term distribution

Quality content about machine learning would discuss neural networks, training data, algorithms, models, accuracy, overfitting, and countless related concepts. Their absence here signals manipulation.

This illustrates why sophisticated ranking algorithms outperform naive keyword counting for information retrieval tasks.
