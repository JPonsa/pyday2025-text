Canine Training Fundamentals

Dogs learn through consistent reinforcement and clear communication. Understanding learning theory enables effective training that strengthens the human-canine bond.

Positive reinforcement principles:
- Reward desired behaviors immediately
- Use high-value treats for challenging tasks
- Fade treat frequency gradually
- Pair verbal praise with rewards
- Timing matters more than treat size

Basic command progression:
1. Sit: Foundation for impulse control
2. Down: Calm settling behavior
3. Stay: Duration and distance building
4. Come: Reliable recall saves lives
5. Leave it: Prevents dangerous ingestion

Common training mistakes:
- Inconsistent cues confuse dogs
- Repeating commands teaches ignoring
- Punishment damages trust
- Training when frustrated
- Sessions too long (keep under 10 minutes)

Leash manners development:
- Start in low-distraction environments
- Reward attention and loose leash
- Stop moving when dog pulls
- Practice direction changes
- Gradually add distractions

Socialization windows:
- Critical period: 3-14 weeks
- Expose to varied experiences positively
- Includes sounds, surfaces, people, animals
- Quality over quantity of exposures
- Continues throughout life at reduced intensity

Addressing problem behaviors:
- Identify underlying cause (fear, boredom, anxiety)
- Manage environment to prevent rehearsal
- Train incompatible alternative behaviors
- Avoid punishment which worsens anxiety
- Consult certified behaviorist for serious issues

Breed differences affect training approach. Herding dogs need mental stimulation. Hounds follow noses. Terriers dig and chase. Working breeds require jobs. Understanding breed tendencies enables realistic expectations.

Professional training options include group classes for socialization, private lessons for specific issues, and board-and-train for intensive work. Certification (CPDT-KA, IAABC) indicates education and ethical standards.
