Simple Terms:
FINDING STUFF IN DOCUMENTS

How do you locate things in lots of text? Here are the basics.

EXACT MATCHING
Type words. Computer finds those exact words. Easy but limited. If you search "happy" you won't find "joyful" even though they mean the same thing.

RANKING RESULTS  
Not all matches are equal. A document mentioning your word 50 times is probably more relevant than one mentioning it once. But be careful - some words are common everywhere ("the", "is", "and"). Those shouldn't count as much.

UNDERSTANDING MEANING
Newer systems try to understand what you actually want, not just the words you typed. Search "cheap flights" and it might show "affordable airfare" results too.

THE TRADEOFF
- Simple keyword search: fast, predictable, misses related stuff
- Smart semantic search: finds related content, slower, sometimes weird results

Most good systems combine both approaches. Quick keyword filter first, then smart ranking second.

SCORING
Results get scores. Higher score = more relevant. The math varies but generally considers:
- How often your words appear
- How rare those words are overall  
- How well the content matches your intent

That's basically it. Everything else is details and optimization.
