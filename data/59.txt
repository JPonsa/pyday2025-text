When Searching for Medical Symptoms Online

The internet provides unprecedented access to health information, but navigating this resource requires critical evaluation skills.

Benefits of online health research:
- Preparation for doctor visits
- Understanding diagnoses and treatments
- Connecting with patient communities
- Accessing specialist knowledge
- Health literacy improvement

Risks and pitfalls:
- Confirmation bias toward feared diagnoses
- Anxiety amplification ("cyberchondria")
- Outdated or inaccurate information
- Anecdotes mistaken for evidence
- Delayed professional consultation

Evaluating health websites:
- Check source credentials (medical institutions, peer review)
- Look for citation of scientific literature
- Note publication and update dates
- Be wary of sites selling related products
- Compare multiple reputable sources

Red flags indicating unreliable content:
- Miracle cure claims
- Conspiracy theories about mainstream medicine
- Heavy reliance on testimonials
- Lack of author credentials
- No references to medical literature

When symptoms warrant immediate attention:
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing
- Sudden severe headache
- Signs of stroke (face drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty)
- Significant bleeding or trauma
- High fever with stiff neck

Don't search - call emergency services.

Using search effectively:
- Include "NIH", "Mayo Clinic", or "NHS" in queries for authoritative results
- Search symptom combinations, not individual symptoms
- Look for systematic information, not forums
- Note information applies to general populations, not your specific case

The internet supplements but never replaces professional medical evaluation. Healthcare providers integrate examination findings, history, and context that no search engine can replicate.
