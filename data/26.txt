Traditional Italian Pasta Carbonara Recipe

Authentic Italian carbonara requires no cream - only eggs, cheese, guanciale, and black pepper. This Roman classic achieves creamy texture through proper technique, not heavy ingredients.

Ingredients:
- 400g spaghetti or rigatoni
- 200g guanciale (cured pork jowl), diced
- 4 large egg yolks + 2 whole eggs
- 100g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt for pasta water

Instructions:
1. Cut guanciale into 1cm cubes and render slowly in a cold pan over medium-low heat until golden and crispy (about 15 minutes). Remove from heat but keep warm.

2. Cook pasta in abundant salted water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining.

3. In a bowl, whisk eggs, egg yolks, grated Pecorino, and generous black pepper until smooth.

4. Working quickly, add hot drained pasta to the pan with guanciale (pan off heat). Pour egg mixture over pasta, tossing vigorously.

5. Add pasta water gradually, 2 tablespoons at a time, continuing to toss until sauce becomes creamy and coats each strand. The residual heat cooks the eggs without scrambling them.

6. Serve immediately with additional Pecorino and black pepper.

Critical points:
- Never add cream to authentic carbonara
- Use guanciale, not pancetta or bacon
- Remove pan from heat before adding eggs
- Work quickly to prevent eggs from scrambling
- Pasta water is essential for proper consistency
