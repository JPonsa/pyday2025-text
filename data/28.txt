French Pastry Fundamentals: Croissant Making

Traditional French croissants require technique and patience but deliver exceptional results. The secret lies in proper lamination - creating butter layers that separate during baking into flaky layers.

Ingredients:
- 500g bread flour
- 300ml cold water
- 10g salt
- 80g sugar
- 10g instant yeast
- 250g cold European butter (82% fat)

Day 1: Dough Preparation
1. Mix flour, water, salt, sugar, and yeast until smooth
2. Knead 5 minutes until elastic
3. Shape into rectangle, wrap in plastic
4. Refrigerate overnight ( develops flavor)

Day 2: Lamination
1. Roll cold butter into 20x15cm rectangle between parchment
2. Roll dough into 40x20cm rectangle
3. Place butter on lower half, fold top down
4. Seal edges, turn 90 degrees, roll to 40x20cm
5. Perform three-fold turns (book fold)
6. Refrigerate 30 minutes between turns
7. Complete total of 4 turns

Shaping and Baking
1. Roll final dough to 5mm thickness
2. Cut triangles (base 12cm, height 25cm)
3. Make small notch at triangle base
4. Roll from base to tip, stretching slightly
5. Curve ends into crescent shape
6. Proof at room temperature 2-3 hours
7. Brush with egg wash
8. Bake at 200°C for 15-20 minutes until golden

Key success factors:
- Keep dough and butter cold throughout lamination
- Use high-fat European butter for best lamination
- Don't overproof - croissants should feel like marshmallows
- Hot oven initial burst creates steam for layers
- Cool on wire rack to maintain crispness
