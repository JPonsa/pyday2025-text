Seasons

Spring whispers through new buds,
Green shoots breaking winter's sleep.
Cherry blossoms paint the dawn,
Life awakens from the deep.

Summer burns in golden light,
Long days stretching into night.
Crickets sing their evening song,
Fireflies dance and drift along.

Autumn paints in red and gold,
Leaves cascade, stories told.
Harvest moon hangs full and bright,
Crisp air in fading light.

Winter wraps in white embrace,
Silent falls the gentle space.
Trees stand bare against the gray,
Promise of return someday.

The City at Midnight

Streetlights blur through rainy glass,
Shadow people hurry past.
Neon signs paint puddles bright,
Urban jungle in the night.

High above the sleeping town,
Stars are drowned by city brown.
Yet somewhere in this concrete maze,
Someone dreams through these long days.

Ocean's Lament

Waves crash on the shore,
Telling tales of yore.
Salt spray in the air,
Whispers of despair.

Endless blue and gray,
Carries ships away.
Deep beneath the foam,
Secrets make their home.

Digital Age

Screens glow in the dark,
We leave our mark.
Likes and follows flow,
In digital snow.

Connection without touch,
Never seeming much.
Vast networks we build,
Yet sometimes feel killed.

Mountain Peak

Climbing toward the sky,
Where eagles fly.
Rock and wind and stone,
Never quite alone.

Summit breath achieved,
What we believed.
World below so small,
Answered to the call.

Coffee Shop

Steam rises from the cup,
Time to drink it up.
Conversations low,
People come and go.

Barista knows your name,
Part of this small game.
Regular routine,
Life between the scenes.
