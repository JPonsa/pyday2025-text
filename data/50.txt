Lexical vs Semantic Search: Understanding the Tradeoffs

Information retrieval has evolved from pure keyword matching toward understanding user intent. Both approaches offer distinct advantages depending on context.

Lexical search examines exact token overlap between queries and documents:

Strengths:
- Extremely fast with inverted indexes
- Highly predictable behavior
- Excellent for known-item search
- No training required
- Works with any language immediately
- Precise when users know exact terminology

Weaknesses:
- Vocabulary mismatch problem
- Cannot understand synonyms
- Misses conceptually related content
- Word order ignored in bag-of-words models
- Struggles with misspellings

Semantic search learns meaning representations:

Strengths:
- Captures synonyms and paraphrases
- Understands conceptual similarity
- Handles vocabulary variations
- Can match across languages (multilingual models)
- Finds related content user might not explicitly request

Weaknesses:
- Computationally expensive
- Requires training data
- May miss exact matches users expect
- Harder to debug and explain
- Vector indexes less mature than inverted indexes

Hybrid approaches combine both:
- BM25 for initial candidate retrieval
- Neural re-ranking for final ordering
- Reciprocal rank fusion combining multiple scores
- Learned sparse representations bridging approaches

Query characteristics suggest optimal approach:
- Named entities → lexical often better
- Conceptual questions → semantic advantageous
- Code search → hybrid with exact matching importance
- Conversational queries → semantic captures intent

Production systems considerations:
- Latency requirements may favor lexical
- Cold start with no training data requires lexical
- High accuracy needs may justify semantic cost
- A/B testing reveals what users actually prefer

The trend moves toward hybrid systems leveraging both paradigms. Fast lexical retrieval provides candidates; semantic models re-rank for relevance. This combination delivers speed and understanding.

Neither approach is universally superior. Understanding tradeoffs enables choosing appropriately for specific applications and user needs.
